# WineWiseAI

## BUSINESS QUESTION:
The wine industry is increasingly competitive, with consumers demanding high-quality products. To meet this demand and ensure consistent quality, there is a need for a red wine quality prediction. This project will enable wineries to assess and enhance their production processes, identify potential issues early, and ultimately improve the overall quality of red wines.

## DATA:
The data is used for the purpose of developing a model  to predict the wine quality based on these physicochemical features. It's common in the field of wine production and quality control, and it can be used to understand the relationship between the chemical composition of wine and the perceived quality by consumers or experts.The dataset is related to the red variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde".

## DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL:
-More research into the analysis of sensory data, including aroma and taste profiles, can lead to more accurate predictions of wine quality based on sensory attributes.
-Predictive models can be extended to create wine recommendation systems that suggest wines to consumers based on their preferences and past ratings.
